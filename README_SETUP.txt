Check that your CK2 mod folder is located here:
      C:\Users\{{USERNAME}}\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod
(If not, the batch files may not work as intended - use with caution!)

Clone this repository into a completely separate location, eg:
      C:\Users\{{USERNAME}}\Documents\GitHub\RedWallCK2

If you make any changes to the mod, make them in the repo folder (eg. ...\Documents\GitHub\RedWallCK2)
 --- Not in the actual CK2 mod folder!

When you're finished making changes and want to test the mod, double-click on "#publish_to_local_mod_folder.bat" to copy all of the mod files to the CK2 mod folder.
 --- WARNING: If you have any changes in the CK2 mod folder, they will be immediately overwritten and lost forever!

If you want to produce a zipped version of the mod (eg. before committing, or for an official release), double-click on "#create_package.bat".

If for some reason you want to pull changes from the mod folder into the GitHub repo, double-click on "#pull_from_local_mod_folder.bat".
 --- WARNING: If you have any uncommitted changes in the repo folder, they will be immediately overwritten and lost forever!
