High-level project direction
============================

 - Is it worthwhile to use CleanSlate as a basis, instead of the base game?
    - In theory, using CleanSlate will make it easier to replace/remove specific items.
    - But you will probably have to designate CleanSlate as a required dependency, which will complicate setup.
 - Decide on a start date
 - Decide what religions will exist, and in general terms what they will do
 - Are there any event chains / decisions / etc which would add flavour for this start date?
    - Formation of the abbey?
 - Decide on an approach to Great Works:
    - Can players construct them? If so, which?
    - Should any already exist in the chosen start date?
    - Do we need to add any custom GWs?
 - Are the base game governments sufficient? Or do you need modded governments?
